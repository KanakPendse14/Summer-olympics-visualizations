# Summer_Olympics_Medal_Analysis
Used Python's matplotlib and pandas to analyse this data I found on Kaggle.

## Introduction

This project is part of DJ Sanghvi IT Sem 4 Python course, year 2023.
The data used for the project is part of Kaggle Dataset.
In this project, we will be visualizing interesting factors that contribute to the mystery, i.e. Summer Olympic Medals (1976-2008).

## About the data

The "Summer Olympics Medals" dataset available on Kaggle is a comprehensive list of all medal winners in the Summer Olympics from 1976 Montreal to 2008 Beijing. The dataset includes every medal awarded during this time period, providing a rich resource for data analysis and predictive modeling.

This dataset is especially useful for beginners who want to learn advanced Excel functions, as it contains a large amount of data that can be used for a variety of analytical tasks. Additionally, this dataset can be leveraged for predictive modeling, enabling analysts to make predictions about which country is likely to win the highest number of gold medals in a particular sports category.

In summary, the "Summer Olympics Medals" dataset is a valuable resource for data scientists, providing a rich source of data that can be used for a wide range of analytical and predictive tasks. By exploring and analyzing this data, analysts can gain insights into trends and patterns in Olympic medal results, as well as develop predictive models to forecast future outcomes.
